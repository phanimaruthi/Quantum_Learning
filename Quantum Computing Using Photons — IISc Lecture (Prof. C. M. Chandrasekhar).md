# 📘 Quantum Computing Using Photons  
## *Class Lecture from IISc*

This document summarises what I **learned and understood** from a lecture by the **Indian Institute of Science (IISc)** on **photon-based quantum computing**. The focus of the session was on how photons can be used as qubits and how quantum computation can be realised using optical systems.

## 🎓 Lecture Focus

The lecture introduced **photonic quantum computing**, where **photons (particles of light)** act as carriers of quantum information. From this session, I gained clarity on how this approach differs from other quantum platforms and why it is an important research direction in quantum technologies.

The class connected **quantum mechanics concepts** with **real experimental implementations**, helping me understand how theory is translated into hardware.

## 🌱 Understanding Quantum Computing

One of the key takeaways was the clear distinction between **classical computing** and **quantum computing**:

- Classical systems use bits (`0` or `1`)
- Quantum systems use **qubits**, which can exist in multiple states at once

The lecture reinforced my understanding of two fundamental principles:

- **Superposition** – enables a qubit to represent multiple states simultaneously  
- **Entanglement** – creates strong correlations between qubits that cannot be explained classically  

These principles explain why quantum computers can outperform classical systems for specific problems.

## 💡 Why Photons Are Used as Qubits

The lecture explained why photons are a strong candidate for implementing qubits. I learned that photons:

- Are **less affected by environmental noise**, helping preserve quantum states
- Can often operate without extreme cooling requirements
- Are naturally suited for **quantum communication and networking**
- Can be precisely controlled using mature optical technologies

This helped me understand why photonic systems are widely studied for scalable and distributed quantum computing.

## 🔧 Encoding Quantum Information in Photons

I learned that quantum information can be encoded in photons using different physical properties, such as:

- **Polarization states**
- **Spatial paths (path encoding)**
- **Time bins or frequency modes**

Each encoding method allows photons to represent qubit states and enables different ways of implementing quantum gates using optical components.

## 🧠 How Computation Is Performed

The lecture showed how **optical elements** act as quantum gates in photonic systems. These include:

- Beam splitters  
- Mirrors  
- Waveplates  
- Phase shifters  

I also understood the difference between:

- **Probabilistic operations**, where gate success depends on measurement outcomes  
- **Deterministic operations**, which are necessary for building scalable quantum processors  

This highlighted a major challenge in photonic quantum computing: achieving reliable, repeatable gate operations.

## 🔍 Key Concepts Clarified

From the session, I gained better clarity on:

- How photonic qubits are physically realised
- The role of **interference and measurement** in quantum optics
- How quantum circuits can be built using linear optical systems
- Why experimental design is critical in quantum hardware development

The lecture helped strengthen my conceptual understanding rather than focusing only on equations.

## 🚀 Research Direction at IISc

The lecture reflects ongoing research at IISc focused on:

- Multi-qubit photonic systems
- Controlled generation of entangled photon states
- Experimental demonstrations of quantum gates
- Bridging theoretical quantum computing with laboratory-scale implementations

This provided insight into how academic research contributes to advancing practical quantum technologies.

## 🧩 What I Gained from This Lecture

- A clearer understanding of **photons as qubits**
- Insight into how **quantum gates** are implemented using optical components
- Awareness of current challenges in scaling photonic quantum computers
- Better appreciation of the link between **quantum theory and experiments**

Overall, this lecture helped me move from a high-level idea of photonic quantum computing to a more **structured and implementation-oriented understanding**.
