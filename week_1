# Week 01 – Foundations of Quantum Computing

This week focused on building strong intuition about what makes quantum computing fundamentally different from classical computing. Instead of jumping directly into algorithms, the emphasis was on understanding *why* quantum systems behave differently and *where* their computational power comes from.

## Qubits vs Classical Bits

In classical computing, a bit can only exist as either `0` or `1`. Even when probability is involved, that uncertainty simply reflects our lack of knowledge about the bit’s actual value.

A **qubit**, on the other hand, behaves very differently.

- A qubit can exist in a **coherent superposition** of `|0⟩` and `|1⟩` at the same time.
- This superposition is a **physical state**, not just probabilistic uncertainty.
- A quantum state is written as:
  
  |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩

- The complex amplitudes α and β allow **interference**, which has no classical equivalent.

Key takeaway:
- Classical probability → lack of information  
- Quantum superposition → physical reality  

This distinction is the foundation of quantum advantage.

## Non-Classical Operations: √NOT Gate

The √NOT (square-root of NOT) gate provides a simple example of how quantum logic differs from classical logic.

- In classical computing, a “half-NOT” operation is meaningless.
- In quantum computing, √NOT is a valid gate.
- Applying √NOT twice results in a full NOT operation.

This shows that:
- Quantum evolution is **continuous**, not discrete.
- Quantum gates are **reversible**.
- Computation is governed by **unitary transformations**.

This helped clarify that quantum computing is not based on Boolean logic, but on **linear algebra and complex vector spaces**.

## Origins of Quantum Computing

Quantum computing did not originate from cryptography.

- In the early 1980s, **Richard Feynman** proposed quantum computers to efficiently simulate quantum systems.
- Classical computers require exponential resources to simulate quantum mechanics.
- Feynman’s insight was that **quantum systems should be simulated using quantum hardware**.

This highlighted that quantum computing emerged from **physics and simulation needs**, not encryption.

## Quantum Hardware Milestone: IBM Quantum Cloud (2016)

A major milestone occurred when IBM made a **real quantum processor accessible via the cloud**.

This enabled:
- Open experimentation
- Hands-on learning
- Benchmarking of real quantum hardware
- Growth of quantum software ecosystems

This marked the transition of quantum computing from a purely theoretical field to an **experimentally accessible technology**.

## DiVincenzo Criteria – What Makes a Practical Quantum Computer?

The **DiVincenzo criteria** define the essential requirements for building a usable quantum computer:

- Scalable, well-characterized qubits
- Ability to initialize qubits to a known state
- A universal set of quantum gates
- Long coherence times
- Reliable measurement

Important clarification:
- **Quantum teleportation is not part of the original criteria**
- The focus is on **physical and engineering feasibility**

This grounded abstract quantum ideas in real hardware constraints.

## Quantum Advantage in Power Grids & Microgrids

Modern power grids are highly complex systems involving:

- Large combinatorial configuration spaces
- Rapid reconfiguration
- Exponentially growing decision possibilities

Classical solvers struggle in worst-case scenarios because:
- The configuration space grows beyond classical tractability

Quantum computing may help by:
- Exploring large configuration spaces more efficiently
- Improving optimization and sampling strategies

This showed that quantum computing has applications beyond chemistry and cryptography.

## Data Explosion in Modern Power Grids

A key insight was that massive data generation in power grids is not primarily caused by sensors.

- A 3,000-node grid generating ~25 TB/day is driven by:
  - Large-scale **Monte Carlo scenario exploration**

This highlights:
- The computational cost of uncertainty analysis
- The need for scalable computing approaches such as **HPC + Quantum hybrid systems**

## Quantum-Secure Cryptography in EV Infrastructure

EV charging infrastructure combines:
- Power delivery
- Financial transactions
- Identity authentication

This creates **dual attack surfaces**, making security critical.

As quantum computers advance:
- Traditional cryptographic schemes may become vulnerable
- **Quantum-secure cryptography** becomes essential

These concerns are **practical and infrastructure-level**, not theoretical.

## Why Classical Computing Still Dominates Today

Despite progress in quantum computing:
- Most utility operations rely on mature, highly optimized classical solvers
- Tasks like unit commitment and dispatch are already well solved classically

Quantum computing:
- Complements classical systems
- Does not replace them in the near term

This reinforces the importance of **hybrid quantum–classical workflows**.

## Reality of Quantum Programming

Quantum programming today resembles early assembly-level programming.

Developers must consider:
- Hardware constraints
- Noise and decoherence
- Qubit connectivity
- Circuit depth

While abstractions are improving, **hardware awareness remains essential**.

## Decentralized Energy & Emerging Challenges

Decentralized energy generation introduces:
- Bi-directional power flow
- Rapid supply fluctuations
- Increased uncertainty

These challenges increase the importance of:
- Optimization techniques
- Accurate forecasting
- Hybrid computation methods

## Quantum Machine Learning (QML) Concepts

In quantum machine learning:
- Entangling gates capture **correlations**, not just individual features
- Classical and quantum models are compared using:
  - Accuracy
  - Error on the same dataset

**Geometric Difference** is used to quantify how different learned feature representations are.

## Neutral Atom & Rydberg Physics

Neutral-atom platforms rely on **Rydberg interactions**, which:
- Can be tuned using the principal quantum number
- Enable strong, controllable interactions

A major scaling challenge is:
- Maintaining millions of precisely controlled laser beams

**Fluorescence imaging** is used to detect atom presence in optical tweezers.

## Cryogenics & Dilution Refrigeration

Quantum hardware often operates at extremely low temperatures.

- Pulse-tube cryocoolers cool systems to ~4 K
- Helium-3 / Helium-4 mixtures enable millikelvin temperatures

Engineering challenges include:
- Large system size
- Heavy weight
- Mechanical stability

## Evaluating Quantum Hardware Performance

The most meaningful performance metric is:
- **Number of quantum gates executable within the coherence time**

Less reliable indicators include:
- Raw qubit count
- Cooling power alone

This emphasizes **useful computation**, not marketing metrics.

## Understanding Quantum Advantage

Not all quantum algorithms offer the same speedup.

- Grover’s algorithm → quadratic speedup
- Shor’s algorithm → exponential speedup

The most promising near-term quantum advantage lies in:
- **Quantum simulation of molecules and materials**

## Quantum Mechanics Refresher: Particle in a Box

For a particle confined in a box:
- Superposition states exhibit oscillating probability density due to interference
- Reducing the box width increases energy eigenvalues

This reinforces how **confinement leads to quantization** in quantum systems.
